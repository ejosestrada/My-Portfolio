Panther Accelerated Career Experience (PACE) offers high-achieving students the chance to collaborate with companies on real-world problems.
My group partnered with Focus Brands, an Atlanta-based company with 5000+ restaurant stores, including Scholttzky’s, Carvel, Cinnabon,
Moe’s Southwest Grill, McAlister’s Deli, Auntie Anne’s, and Jamba brands. Our task was to diversify ownership to attract investors interested in opening multiple stores.

After discussions with Marketing and Business Development, we decided to focus our efforts in North Carolina. This code requires a Google API key for 
accessing Maps and obtaining geometric data for major cities in NC. This market and competitor analysis forms part of a comprehensive strategy for 
Focus Brands to identify prime opportunities and assess potential investments.
