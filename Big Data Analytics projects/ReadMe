There are two directories in here. One contains all of the projects that I did for this course named Projects, and the other one named Capstone contains the final deliverable for a major assignment that was worked on
throughout the semester. 

Each directory has all R scripts and all the CSV files needed to run. Keep in mind to properly set your working directory
